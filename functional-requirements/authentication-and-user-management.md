# Authentication and User management

The system supports secure registration and login using JWT and OAuth2, with email verification required upon account creation. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security.

Users have personal profiles containing information such as name, photo, gender, residence, languages, skills, area, and date of birth. Roles are assigned as either **admin** or **regular user (Project Manager or User)**, with access levels varying accordingly.

Admins have the ability to update users' areas and are solely responsible for creating new projects. Each user can only change their own password, ensuring personal data security and control.
