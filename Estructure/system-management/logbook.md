# Logbook

**Logbook Overview**\
The logbook feature is designed to provide full traceability of actions performed within the system. Project Managers (PMs) and system administrators can use this tool to monitor activity, ensure accountability, and support audit or troubleshooting efforts. By offering both high-level and detailed views of system actions, the logbook enhances transparency and control across projects.
