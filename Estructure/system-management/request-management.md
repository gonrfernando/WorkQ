# Request Management

**Request Management Overview**\
This section outlines the functional requirements for managing change requests within the system. It focuses on providing administrators with visibility into current and past requests, as well as the ability to review, approve, or deny them. The goal is to ensure that all change requests are handled efficiently, with full access to relevant details for informed decision-making.

**Functional Requirements**

1. **View Change Requests**
   * As a system admin, you can see a list of all current and past change requests related to the project.
2. **Accept or Deny Requests**
   * The super admin can accept or deny each change request.
3. **View Change Request Details**
   * The super admin can click on each change request to clearly view all the information associated with that request.
