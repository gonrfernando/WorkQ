# Project Creation

This section outlines the requirements for creating new projects within the system. The process must allow users to input essential project details and ensure data integrity through validation of required fields and logical date ranges. The interface should be intuitive and responsive to facilitate a smooth and efficient project setup experience.

**Functional Requirements**

1. **Create New Project**
   * The system must allow the creation of a new project with success, including saving the project data in the database.
   * The project data must include:
     * Project name
     * Description
     * Start date
     * End date
2. **Empty Inputs Validation**
   * The system must validate empty inputs for fields like project name, description, icon, start date, and end date, showing an error message if any required fields are left empty.
3. **Valid Date Range**
   * The system must ensure that the projectâ€™s start date is before the end date, and it should show an error message if the date range is invalid.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* The project creation interface must be understandable, interactive, and visually pleasant.
* Ensure the project creation process is quick and responsive.
