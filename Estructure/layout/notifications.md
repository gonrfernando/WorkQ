# Notifications

**Notification System Requirements**\
This section outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the notification system. The goal is to ensure users are promptly informed of updates, with a user-friendly interface that supports quick access, filtering, and clear visual cues.

**Functional Requirements**

**View Notifications**\
The system must allow users to view their notifications.

* The user must be able to click on the bell icon to open a list of the most recent notifications.
* Notifications should be displayed in two distinct categories:
  * Unread notifications in black.
  * Read notifications in gray.

**Filter Notifications**

* The system must allow users to filter their notifications.
* A filter icon should be available; clicking it displays a menu where users can select different types of notifications.



***

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* The notifications interface must be clear and easy to navigate, with a simple visual distinction between read and unread notifications.
* The notification configuration options should be responsive and intuitive, allowing users to quickly adjust their preferences.
