# Backend

*   Our backend is powered by a robust stack centered on **Python (Pyramid)** for web development. We use **Pyramid\_jinja2** and **Jinja2** for templating, and **PostgreSQL** as our database, with **SQLAlchemy**, **Psycopg2**, and **Alembic** handling data access and migrations.

    Security is enforced through **Bcrypt** and **Werkzeug** for password hashing and encryption. **Boto3** and **smtplib** support cloud services and email communication. The app is served via **Waitress**, and tested using **WebTest**, **Pytest**, and **Webtest-sessions**.
